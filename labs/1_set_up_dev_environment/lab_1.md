# Lab 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Welcome to the first lab! In this lab, you'll set up your development environment for building AI agents with LangGraph and AWS Amplify using an interactive Jupyter notebook. By the end of this lab, you'll have a fully configured development environment ready for building AI agents.

## Getting Started with the Notebook

1. Ensure you have Jupyter notebook installed with the JavaScript kernel:
   ```bash
   npm install -g ijavascript
   ijsinstall
   ```

2. Navigate to the lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd labs/lab_1
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Lab1.ipynb
   ```

## Working with the Notebook

The `Lab1.ipynb` notebook contains interactive cells that will guide you through:

- Verifying your Node.js installation
- Checking AWS credentials
- Setting up the project structure
- Installing required dependencies

Each step in the notebook contains:
- Markdown cells with instructions and explanations
- Code cells you can execute to perform the setup tasks
- Output cells showing the results of your commands

## Prerequisites

Before starting the notebook, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18.x or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Jupyter notebook with JavaScript kernel support

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues:

1. **Jupyter Notebook Issues**
   - Ensure the JavaScript kernel is properly installed
   - Try restarting the kernel if cells aren't executing
   - Check the kernel logs for error messages

2. **AWS Authentication Errors**
   - Verify your AWS credentials are properly set
   - Check your AWS CLI configuration
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions

3. **Node.js Problems**
   - Verify Node.js is installed and in your PATH
   - Check that the version is 18.x or later
   - Try restarting your terminal

## Next Steps

After completing the notebook:
✅ Your development environment will be configured
✅ AWS credentials will be verified
✅ Project dependencies will be installed
✅ You'll be ready for Lab 2

Continue to [Lab 2: Building Your First LangGraph Agent](lab_2.md) after successfully completing all notebook cells.
