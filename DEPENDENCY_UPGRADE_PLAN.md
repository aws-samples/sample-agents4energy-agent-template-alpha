# Dependency Upgrade Plan

## Current Issues Analysis

### Security Issues
- **1 low severity vulnerability**: `brace-expansion` in aws-cdk-lib (fixable with `npm audit fix`)

### Deprecation Warnings (Transitive Dependencies)
Most deprecated packages are transitive dependencies from older versions of your direct dependencies:
- `figgy-pudding`, `urix`, `har-validator` - likely from older webpack/build tools
- `vue@2.7.16` - suggests some dependency hasn't migrated from Vue 2
- `webpack-chain` - outdated build tooling
- `request@2.88.2` - old HTTP client, replaced by axios/fetch
- `glob@7.2.3` - old file globbing, needs v9+

### Major Version Updates Available
- **React 19**: Available but may have breaking changes
- **Next.js 15**: Available but may have breaking changes  
- **Material-UI v7**: Available but may have breaking changes
- **ESLint 9**: Available but has breaking changes
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Available but in beta

## Recommended Upgrade Strategy

### Phase 1: Safe Updates (Low Risk)
Update packages within same major version:

```bash
# AWS SDK packages (safe updates)
npm update @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
npm update @aws-sdk/client-api-gateway @aws-sdk/client-athena @aws-sdk/client-sqs @aws-sdk/client-textract @aws-sdk/lib-storage

# AWS Amplify packages
npm update @aws-amplify/backend @aws-amplify/backend-cli @aws-amplify/backend-output-schemas @aws-amplify/ui-react aws-amplify

# LangChain packages
npm update @langchain/aws @langchain/community @langchain/mcp-adapters

# Development tools
npm update @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom typescript tsx
npm update mocha chai puppeteer postcss
```

### Phase 2: Medium Risk Updates
```bash
# Chart.js and related
npm update chart.js

# Build tools
npm update aws-cdk aws-cdk-lib

# Utilities
npm update cheerio dotenv
```

### Phase 3: High Risk Updates (Requires Testing)
These may have breaking changes:
- React 19 (from 18.3.1)
- Next.js 15 (from 14.2.31) 
- Material-UI v7 (from v6)
- ESLint 9 (from 8.57.1)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (from 3.4.17)

### Phase 4: Address Transitive Dependencies
After updating direct dependencies, many deprecated warnings should resolve automatically.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix Security Issue**: `npm audit fix`
2. **Phase 1 Updates**: Safe minor/patch updates
3. **Test Application**: Ensure everything works
4. **Phase 2 Updates**: Medium risk updates
5. **Test Again**: Verify functionality
6. **Consider Phase 3**: Only if needed and after thorough testing

## Notes
- Most deprecation warnings are from transitive dependencies
- Updating direct dependencies should resolve many warnings
- Major version updates should be done carefully with testing
- Consider staying on stable versions for production applications
