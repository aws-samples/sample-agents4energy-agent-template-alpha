Agents4Energy (A4E) is an easily configurable and deployable, set of open-source agentic workflows to help customers in Energy industry accelerate their workloads on AWS. A4E enables industry professionals to use generative AI assistants for a range of common energy industry use cases such as reservoir characterization, well workover assessment, field data analysis, supply chain optimization, and asset integrity management.

To address the needs of the energy industry and harness the great power presented by GenAI, AWS is proud to announce Agents4Energy. This solution makes it easy for operators and service companies to incorporate the sixth generation of computing into their existing technical environments. Much like a travel agent handles the nitty-gritty details of booking a vacation for you, energy agents scan diverse data sources and enterprise systems to unlock insights and complete tasks on your behalf.

## Architecture Overview

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the GenAI Agentic platform:
