    `I manage a fleet of wind farms and want to maximize energy production while minimizing operational expense. 
Let me check our fleet performance for this quarter. Compare the actual production to the forecasted production for each wind farm.
Generate the necessary time series data to create a dashboard to visualize the performance of each wind farm.`,
    `I have a fleet of compressors and I'd like to optimize the maintenance schedule.
Generate non-optimized data about historic maintenance, compressor failures, and time series data.
Analyze the data to find an optimized maintenance plan and estimate the cost savings.
Create a comprehensive report and render it for visualization.`,
    `I compare completion designs and oil production data for an upstream oil company.
Generate 10,000 well fracturing completion designs (well spacing, lateral length, perforation cluster spacing, pumped water volumes, pumped proppand sand lbs, number of frac'ing stages)
Generate production data for these wells. There should be a relationship between the completion design and production numbers. The production should loosely follow a hyperbolic decline and have some noise.
After generating the data, perform an analysis to determine optimal completion design parameters to maximize production.
Create a comprehensive report and render it for visualization.
